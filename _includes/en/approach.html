    In my work, the person with their needs and relationships is at the center. I strongly believe that every
    individual has the capacity for change and self-healing. From a systemic perspective, I do not only
    focus on the individual but also on their relationships and the environment in which they live.

    My goal is to help you on your journey to gain clarity, resolve conflicts, and develop new perspectives.
