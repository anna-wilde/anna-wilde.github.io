What does "systemic" actually mean?



The systemic approach originally stems from family therapy in the 1950s and has undergone constant development ever since. Over time, the approach has been shaped by various movements and is now applied across a range of fields. Today, there is systemic coaching or supervision, systemic family therapy, systemic psychotherapy (recognized as a standard treatment for adults since 2018 and for children and adolescents since 2024), and even systemic organizational development.


But what does “systemic” actually mean, and what makes this approach so special?

The systemic approach assumes that we, as individuals, live within systems and cannot be understood apart from our environment. In other words, our actions, thoughts, and feelings make sense within their specific context. Individual values or belief systems can also be meaningful when viewed within the context of a person’s biography — even if they may seem completely incomprehensible to an outsider. Our value system essentially serves as a compass guiding us through life. The systemic perspective holds that this value compass is shaped with personal meaning.

Here, one of the core influences of the systemic approach comes into play: constructivism. Constructivism assumes that values, relationship models, or worldviews are social constructs. All social interactions, then, are socially constructed. This means that my personal construct of, for example, love or what makes a happy relationship is inevitably different from someone else’s. Our internal maps of values are shaped by our life experiences and personal environments, so that each of us looks at the shared landscape through our own lens, with our own understanding of how social constructs make sense to us.


What does this mean for therapy?

In a therapeutic setting, this means that as a therapist, I cannot know exactly what the construct of love or family looks like for my client. In systemic therapy, this is referred to as the "not-knowing position." It reflects the belief that clients are the experts of their own lives and lived realities.

It also means that I do not work with assumptions or ready-made solutions (like “Have you tried... That’s supposed to be really helpful…”). Instead, my therapeutic compass is oriented toward supporting my client in their own search for meaning and solutions. It’s more about encouraging resources or solutions that make sense within the client’s individual context and life experience.
