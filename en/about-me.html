                        As a systemic therapist, my main focus is on relationships â€” whether within families, partnerships, or in
                        teams and organizations. Just as important to my work is the relationship we each have with
                        ourselves.
                    </p><p>
                        When limiting beliefs come into play, it can sometimes be challenging to align our needs with our
                        decisions and the expectations we perceive around us.
                    </p><p>
                        Our self-image and the relationship we have with ourselves often shape how we make decisions, set
                        boundaries, and allow ourselves to meet our own needs. Times of conflict or crisis present an
                        opportunity to bring these dynamics into focus and, ultimately, to adjust them in new and helpful
                        ways.
